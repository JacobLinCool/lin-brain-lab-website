## Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has millimeter spatial resolution and versatile contrasts. MRI has been extensively used in clinical medicine and neuroscience studies to provide structural, functional, and metabolic information. We devote to advancing the MRI technology in order to improve its spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity. We aim at developing a tailored combination of receiver coil array, spatial encoding magnetic fields, main magnetic field, pulse sequences, and image reconstruction algorithms in order to optimize MRI in different neuroscience and clinical applications.

## Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG)
EEG and MEG are methods of studying the neural activities non-invasively using extracranial measurements of magnetic fields and electric potentials, respectively. We continuously develop EEG and MEEG methods in order to better understand how human brain works via studies of MEG/EEG source localization, neuronal oscillations, and multi-modal (EEG/MEG/MRI) integration.
## Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
TMS stimulates neural populations at the cortex via transient and strong magnetic pulses delivied by coils outside the head. We use neuroimaging (MRI/EEG/MEG) and navigation systems to excite and inhibit neural activity in a spatiotemporally accurate way.
