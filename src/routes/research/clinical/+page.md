We enthisatically translate our methodologies to neurological and psychiatric health care.

## Epilepsy
We use concurrent EEG-MRI measurement to delineate epileptogenic regions for medicall refractory patients.

## Psychiatric disorders
We use complex naturalistic (audiovisual) stimuli to detect and characterize brain areas with impaired high-order cognitive functions, such as sense of humor and social perception. This neuroimaging paradigm can be used for mental health care for Schizophrenia, depression, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar individuals.

## Neurodegenerative disease
Neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, can be manifested in memory decline. We develop non-invasive imaging and interventional methods to measure and  promote neural substrates supporting this crucial brain function.
