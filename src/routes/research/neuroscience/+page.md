## Brain activities under complex naturalistic stimuli
We use materials of rich audiovisual contents to detect and characterize brain areas underpinning high-order cognitive functions, such as the sense of humor, emotion regulation, music perception, and social perception.

## Neurovascular coupling of the human brain
We use high spatiotemporal resolution data across imaging modalies to measure neural (MEG, EEG, SEEG) and hemodynamic responses (fMRI) of the human brain. These data shed light on how information is processed and integrated in the brain.
